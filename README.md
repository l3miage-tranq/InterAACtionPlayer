## YouTube Search API

To use the YouTube search API in this project, you'll need to register for an API token.

When that's done, head over to the [Google developer console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?pli=1&project=projectyoutubesearch&folder=&organizationId=) page.  
Once the project is successfully created, follow the steps below to get an API token :  
1. Navigate to the credentials page by clicking on Credentials located on the sidebar menu;  
2. Click on the + CREATE CREDENTIALS button located at the top of the page and select API key. A new API key should be created. Copy that key and store it somewhere safe;  
3. Head over to the API and Services page by clicking on APIs & Services located at the top of the sidebar;  
4. Click on ENABLE APIs AND SERVICES at the top of the page. You’ll be redirected to a new page. Search for the YouTube Data API and click on the Youtube Data API v3 option. Once again, you’ll be redirected to another page. Click Enable to allow access to that API.  
   
Now, just put the key you copy before in the variable API_TOKEN in ProjectMultimedia -> projects -> youtube -> src -> app -> shared -> services -> search.service.ts (line 17).
With that done, you can use the YouTube API.
